# Downgrade index.html file for Bose QuietComfort Earbuds

Recently, I bought a Bose QC Earbuds with `1.0.7` version.

After connecting with Bose Music APP, I found the Earbuds was upgrade to `2.0.7` , which broke down the noise cancelling ability to a very low level. This made me think it shouldn't worth so much money.

And I asked  the official customer service if they could downgrade it, and they said there is no way to do with it now.

I searched Google and GITHUB, found a Bose firmware ced repo contained some custom indexl.xml, which is read by BoseUpdate App to offer ability to downgrade the firmwave hidden by Bose. But it did not contained the QC Earbuds mode.

After some trying, I found the old version firmware download path, and successly download the file.

Let's see if I could make it :)
